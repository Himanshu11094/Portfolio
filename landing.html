												<h2 id="content">Why you should take part in FSAE?</h2>
											 
											<p> Participating in Formula SAE (FSAE) can be an incredibly rewarding experience for engineering students for several reasons:
											
<br>1: Hands-on Experience: FSAE provides a unique opportunity for students to apply the concepts and theory they have learned in the classroom to a real-world project. They get to work on a real engineering problem and see the impact of their work.

<br>2: Teamwork and Collaboration: FSAE requires a significant amount of teamwork and collaboration to design, build, and test a competitive race car. Students learn to work in interdisciplinary teams and develop effective communication skills.

<br>3: Industry Exposure: FSAE provides students with an opportunity to network with industry professionals and potential employers. They get to showcase their skills, knowledge, and accomplishments to industry leaders and learn about career opportunities in the automotive industry.

<br>4: Leadership and Project Management: FSAE offers students the chance to take on leadership roles and develop project management skills. They learn to manage budgets, schedules, and resources effectively and develop a sense of responsibility and ownership.

<br>5: Professional Development: FSAE provides students with an opportunity to develop their professional skills, such as public speaking, technical writing, and presentation skills. They also gain experience in competition and learn to handle pressure and setbacks.

<br>Overall, participating in FSAE can be an incredibly valuable experience for engineering students. It offers them a chance to apply their skills and knowledge in a real-world setting, develop teamwork and leadership skills, and prepare for a successful career in the automotive industry.

										<h2>FSAE (Formula SAE)</h2>
									</header>
									<p>FSAE (Formula SAE) is a student engineering competition that challenges teams to design and build a single-seat race car to compete in a variety of events. The competition is organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and is open to universities and colleges worldwide.
<br>
The competition typically involves teams of engineering students who design, build, and test a small formula-style race car that is judged on a variety of criteria, including design, performance, and cost. The event consists of both static and dynamic events, including design, cost, and business presentations, as well as acceleration, skid pad, autocross, endurance, and fuel efficiency tests.
<br>
The goal of the competition is to provide students with hands-on engineering experience and to prepare them for careers in the automotive industry. Students gain valuable skills in design, manufacturing, testing, project management, and teamwork, while also networking with industry professionals and potential employers.
<br>
The competition rules and regulations are updated each year to reflect changes in technology and industry trends. The competition is highly competitive and requires a significant investment of time, effort, and resources from participating teams. However, the rewards of the experience are many and can lead to successful careers in the automotive industry.</p>
